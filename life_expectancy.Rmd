# Abstract

Here we examine a life expectancy plot

# Analysis

We will first clean the data

```{r}
library(gapminder)
library(tidyverse)
gu <- gapminder_unfiltered
gu %>%
  group_by(year) %>%
  filter(lifeExp == max(lifeExp)) %>%
  select(country, year, lifeExp) %>% 
  arrange(year) -> gu2

ggplot(data = gu2,
       mapping = aes(x= year, y = lifeExp))+
  geom_point(aes(fill = country), color = "black", pch = 21)+
  geom_smooth(se=FALSE, method = lm, color = "blue")+
  theme_bw()

```

We will now recreate the plot from Oeppen and Vaupel (2002).

```{r}

```
